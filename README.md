# Ex-Nihilo-Aliquid_BN
A short but sweet mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights
### Introduction
The mod Ex Nihilo Aliquid (Out of Nothing, Something) introduces a new branch to the cultivation of the self. Specifically, it adds a brand new 'mental' path towards excellence. If we consider mutations to be the physical aspect of self-cultivation, this mod gives a unique complementary path dedicated to the mental side of things. It is quite a simple mod, and players may anticipate something like the Esper powers from Caves of Qud or Mind Over Matter from DDA.
### Guide
A spoiler-free guide is outlined in the following. You may either choose to start with a profession that starts out with the basic fundamentals, the [Δ]Mentat, or chance upon a book while exploring the world that propels you towards the path.
### Powers and Progression (Minor Spoilers)
The mental path is divided into six ranks or stages. Natalist, Solipsist, Positivist, Absurdist, Abstractionist, and Idealist.

The player has two methods of progression.

First, one may choose to level up the good old fashioned way, referred to as the orthodox method. The player will have to level up any spell to level 3, at which point the spells of the next rank will be automatically learned. But as levelling up this way alone is difficult, one may also craft tomes that will allow the player to gain spell EXP by reading. A slight warning about this function is already addressed in the in-game texts I added, so please read them carefully.

However, even this may take a long time. At which case the player may choose to pursue the second method, which is usually referred to as the inferior or unorthodox method. You skip the need to practice spells altogether and instead craft a manuscript that is the culmination of pure, imaginative training. Reading this new book will instantly give you a corresponding trait and all its spells. For example, a Natalist progressing to Solipsist in this manner won't ever even have to cast a single Natalist spell to receive the spells of the Solipsist. Yet, this path has its downsides. You will progressively grow physically weaker as you progress down this path, and the ultimate ceiling is different for an orthodox and unorthodox practitioner.

Let me just say that if you persist in the orthodox method, a very good reward lies at the end of the road. The unorthodox method grants a similar reward, but it is far inferior in quality.

They may have traversed to a different universe where an infinite number of lost pens congregate. Think about it.'
